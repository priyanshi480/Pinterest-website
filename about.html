<h2><u>What is Pinterest?</u></h2>
<p>Pinterest is a social network that allows users to visually share, and discover new interests by posting (known as ‘pinning’) 
images or videos to their own or others’ boards (i.e. a collection of ‘pins,’ usually with a common theme) and browsing
 what other users have pinned. </p>
