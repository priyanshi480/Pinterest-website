<p style= "color: rgb(49, 48, 99); font-size:50px;"> A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust,
 generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. 
A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, 
typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. </p>
